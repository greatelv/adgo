description: Verify project health by checking for build and type errors
---

1. Run type checking to catch authorized TypeScript errors.
   `pnpm tsc --noEmit`

2. Run a dry-run build to ensure the project can compile successfully.
   `pnpm build`

3. If any errors occur, FIX THEM immediately before reporting task completion.
